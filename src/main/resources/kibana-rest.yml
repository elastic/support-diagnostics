# The new settings format:
# At the top level the label descring the query that will also be used as the
#   file name for its output.
#   Below the query label are the following attributes:
#     * extension - the file extension to be used for output. Optional, defaults to .json.
#     * subdir - some api's are now grouped in a subdirectory of the output directory to lessen clutter. Optional, defaults to root dir.
#     * retry - whether if a query fails it will be retried for the configured number of attempts. Optional, defaults to false.
#     * versions - it can be:
#       * A map constituted of "semver rules" and its associated "url/api" to run (`">= 7.0.0" : "/api/someendpoint/"`)
#       * A map constituted of "semver rules" and its associated structure:
#         * url - required field representing the API to be used
#         * spaceaware - optional boolean option representing the fact the field is space aware. IF set, the API will be scraped for each space
#         * paginate - optional string option representing the pagination field name. If set, the API will be paginated using the field name
#   
#   The "semver rules" within "versions" must resolve EXACTLY TO ONE "url/api"
#   NPM mode is the only one used: https://github.com/vdurmont/semver4j
#   NPM Versioning rules are documented here: https://github.com/npm/node-semver
#
#   Note to those adding entries: within each group, cat API's, json API's, and commercial, they are in alphabetical order.
#   Please adhere to this convention when submitting pull requests.
